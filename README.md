## 🧠 About Me  
Hey there — I’m Benjamin, a systems-minded developer passionate about building and securing the backbone of modern computing.  
Currently operating from the Ubuntu terminal, I focus on **secure software engineering**, **network defense**, and **automation tools** for real-world deployment.  

My mission: *to merge cybersecurity precision with software efficiency.*  
When I’m not debugging or testing scripts, I’m studying network architecture, exploring ethical hacking, or optimizing Linux systems for performance and security.
